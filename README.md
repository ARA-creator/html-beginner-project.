# html-beginner-project.
Description:
This is a heartfelt HTML tribute page dedicated to the memory of Ishmaelina Ivy Arhin â€” a beloved mother, sister, and friend. The page includes her photo, a video, significant life events, achievements, and a favorite quote. Created by her daughter, Araba Eshun, this page is a personal web memorial designed with semantic HTML5 elements and emotional storytelling.

Key Features:

Semantic HTML structure using <header>, <main>, <section>, <figure>, <address>, and more.

Embedded video and image.

Responsive meta tags for better viewing experience.

Personal contact section and memory details.

Custom metadata for social sharing (og:title, og:description, og:image).

Note:
This project is purely HTML-based and meant as a tribute/memorial. It does not include any CSS or JavaScript at this stage. Media files (images/videos) should be locally available in the same project folder for full functionality.
